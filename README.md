# Entity-relationship-model-Checkpoint

Based on the information provided, we can create an Entity-Relationship (ER) model that captures the relevant entities and their relationships for the gym chain. Below are the suggested entities, their attributes, and the relationships between them:

Entities and Attributes:
Gym
Attributes:
GymID (Primary Key)
Name - Address - Telephone Number2. Member
Attributes:
MemberID (Primary Key)
Last Name - First Name - Address - Date of Birth - Gender - GymID (Foreign Key referencing Gym)
Session
Attributes:
SessionID (Primary Key)
Sport Type - Schedule - Max Capacity (fixed at20)
GymID (Foreign Key referencing Gym)
Coach
Attributes:
CoachID (Primary Key)
Last Name - First Name - Age - Specialty### Relationships:
Registers
Relationship between Member and Session
Type: Many-to-Many (A member can register for multiple sessions, and a session can have multiple members.)
Attributes (if needed):
RegistrationID (Primary Key)
SessionID (Foreign Key referencing Session)
MemberID (Foreign Key referencing Member)
Leads
Relationship between Session and Coach
Type: Many-to-Many (A session can be led by up to two coaches, and a coach can lead multiple sessions.)
Attributes (if needed):
LeadingID (Primary Key)
SessionID (Foreign Key referencing Session)
CoachID (Foreign Key referencing Coach)
ER Diagram Representation:
Here is a textual representation of how the entities could be related in a diagram:

scss
[ Gym ]  
 |1---n |  
[ Member ]---(Registers)---[ Session ]---(Leads)---[ Coach ]  
Notes:
Gym: Each gym can have many members and sessions but is represented as a single entity.
Member has a foreign key GymID to associate with the Gym they are registered at.
Session also has a foreign key GymID to indicate which gym the session belongs to.
The Registers relationship would potentially have additional attributes (like registration date), but the main idea is that it connects members to sessions.
The Leads relationship connects sessions to coaches, allowing for the association of multiple coaches to each session but limiting it to a maximum of2.
This Entity-Relationship model helps in designing a database structure that can effectively manage gym registrations, sessions, and coach assignments.
